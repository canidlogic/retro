=head1 NAME

Retro::Assembler - OPL2 hardware script assembler module.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Construct a new assembler instance with 60 Hz control rate
  my $asm = Retro::Assembler->create(60);
  
  # Define register writes in any chronological order
  $asm->reg($t, $addr, $val);
  
  # Update total duration of assembly, possbily multiple times
  $asm->dur($total_duration);
  
  # Build the whole assembly file
  $asm->build("path/to/file.opl2");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assemble an OPL2 hardware script given register write instructions and
total duration information in any chronological order.

When the assembler is constructed, you must specify the control rate in
Hz.  The assembler starts out empty with total duration zero and no
register writes defined.

You can then issue C<reg()> and C<dur()> calls in any chronological
order whatsoever.  C<reg()> calls schedule a hardware register write at
a certain point in time, and C<dur()> calls increase the total duration
of the performance if necessary.

When all the information has been specified, call C<build()> to create
the completed hardware script.  All the register writes that were
scheduled will be sorted in chronological order, and the hardware script
will proceed through time sequentially.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item B<create(rate)>

Create a new OPL2 assembler instance.

C<rate> is the control rate to declare in the header of the hardware
script that will be generated by C<build()>.  It must be an integer in
range [1, 1024], specifying the rate in Hz.

The assembler starts out with no scheduled writes and a total duration
of zero.  Both C<reg()> and C<dur()> calls will possibly lengthen the
total duration.  C<reg()> will add a scheduled write.  Scheduled writes
are buffered in memory, with each scheduled write packed into a single
integer value.

When all writes have been scheduled and the total duration is correct,
use C<build()> to write a sequential hardware script and reset the state
of the assembler to its initial state.

=head1 PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item B<reg(t, addr, val)>

Schedule a register write.

C<t> is the offset in time of the register write, expressed in the
number of cycles at the control rate that have elapsed since the start
of the performance.  It must pass C<rtIsInteger()> from C<Retro::Util>
and it must be zero or greater.  It also must be one less than the
maximum integer value, for a full range of [0, 2147483646].

You may schedule register write events in any order.  They do not have
to be added chronologically.

C<addr> is the OPL2 register address to write.  It must pass
C<rtIsInteger()> and its range must be [0, 255].

C<val> is the value to write into the OPL2 register at address C<addr>
at time C<t>.  It must pass C<rtIsInteger()> and its range must be
[0, 255].

All the scheduled register writes will be buffered in memory until the
C<build()> function is called.  Each scheduled write takes up one scalar
integer worth of memory in an array.

This function will automatically extend the total duration of the
composition if necessary to include the given C<t> value, as if C<dur>
was called with a value one greater than C<t>.

  # Extend the duration if necessary
  unless ($self->{'_dur'} > $t) {
    $self->{'_dur'} = $t + 1;
  }
}

=item B<dur(d)>

Extend the length of the performance if necessary to the given duration.

C<d> is the total duration of the performance, expressed in a number of
cycles at the control rate.  C<d> must pass C<rtIsInteger()> from the
C<Retro::Util> module, and it must be zero or greater.

If the current total duration of the performance is less than C<d>, it
will be updated to C<d>.  However, if the current total duration of the
performance is greater than or equal to C<d>, this method call is
ignored.

In other words, this method can only extend the length of a performance.
It can not shorten the length.

sub dur {
  # Get self and parameters
  ($#_ == 1) or die;
  
  my $self = shift;
  (ref($self) and $self->isa(__PACKAGE__)) or die;
  
  my $d = shift;
  rtIsInteger($d) or die;
  ($d >= 0) or die;
  
  # Extend the duration if necessary
  unless ($self->{'_dur'} >= $d) {
    $self->{'_dur'} = $d;
  }
}

=item B<build(path)>

Build a full OPL2 assembly file.

C<path> is the path to the file that should be created or overwritten
with the generated OPL2 hardware script.  The file format of this
hardware script is documented in the Retro Specification.

Before using this function, schedule all necessary hardware writes with
C<reg()> and make sure the total performance duration is as you want it,
possibly using C<dur()> one or more times to update the total duration.

This function will sort all the scheduled writes in chronological order
and then build the hardware script so that all writes take place at the
scheduled time and the total of the hardware script matches the total
duration established in this assembler object.

The state of the assembler object will be cleared back to initial state
after this function completes.

Fatal errors occur if there are any problems building the script.  It is
not an error if two or more writes to the same register are scheduled at
the same time, provided that all the writes have the same value.  If any
of the writes have a different value, however, an error occurs.  In the
output hardware script, redundant writes will be dropped.
