%retro-synth;

# Example Shastina file for Retro synthesizer.
#
# The tokens are case-sensitive.
#
# The first command must be a meta command "retro-synth".
#
# Then come configuration commands, show below.  The configuration
# commands must come before anything else in the file.  The
# configuration commands may be in any order.

# Configuration command establishing the sample rate.
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   48000 (Hz)
#   44100 (Hz)
#
# This configuration command is required.
#
%rate 48000;

# Configuration command establishing the output amplitude.
#
# This must be in range 1-32767.
#
# This configuration command is required.
#
%sqamp 20000;

# If you want to generate a non-stereo file, include the configuration
# command that is commented-out below.
#
# All stereo positioning will be ignored and the output will be
# single-channel if this configuration command is included.
#
# %nostereo;

# By default, one second of silence is written before and after the
# synthesized sound.  If you want to change that, you can optionally
# use the configuration command that is commented-out below to specify
# the before and after times in sample counts.  Zero is valid for either
# or both.
#
# %frame 48000 48000;

# After the configuration commands comes the main part of the file.

# You can define layers like this:  (Layers are one-indexed.)
[
  0 512 lc,       # Constant intensity 512/1024 @ sample 0
  48000 512 0 lr, # Ramp 512/1024 -> 0/1024 @ sample 48000
  50000 1024 lc   # Constant intensity 1024/1024 @ sample 50000

] 1024 1 layer  # Layer 1 definition, 1024/1024 multiplier

# You can also derive layers from other layers using a different
# multiplier.  The graph objects will be shared.
#
# The following derives layer 2 from layer 1, using a new multiplier of
# 512/1024 against the graph of layer 1.
#
512 1 2 derive_layer

# You can define instruments like this:  (Instruments are one-indexed.)
#
1024        # Maximum intensity 1024/1024
256         # Minimum intensity 256/1024
10          # Attack time in milliseconds
10          # Decay time in milliseconds
512         # Sustain level 512/1024
10          # Release time in milliseconds
  1 instr   # Define instrument 1

# You can duplicate the definition of an instrument.  The ADSR envelope
# is shared between the two instruments:
#
1 2 instr_dup # Duplicate instrument 1 as instrument 2

# You can change instrument definitions.  Change max/min intensities
# like this:
#
512 256 2 instr_maxmin  # Change max/min on instrument 2

# All instruments have stereo position in center when they are first
# defined.  To get other stereo positions, you must change the stereo
# position after definition.
#
# If %nostereo; was specified as a configuration command, then stereo
# positioning will be ignored and everything will be single-channel.

-512 0 1024 12 1 instr_field
# Set stereo field (512/1024) left to (1024/1024) right from middle C
# to one octave above on instrument 1

0 2 instr_stereo
# Set constant center stereo position on instrument 2

# You also give note definitions here.  The t values and dur values are
# in samples.  t offsets do not include the silence frames defined by
# the %frame; command.
#
# Notes may be given in any order.  Nothing is actually synthesized
# until the full Shastina file has been interpreted.  This also means
# that instrument and layer definitions use the instrument and layer
# state at the end of the Shastina file, NOT when the note is first
# defined.
#
# It is also acceptable to define instruments and layers after the notes
# have been defined.

0 48000 9 1 2 n
# Define note @ t=0, for 48000 samples, A-440, instrument 1, layer 2

# The full synthesizer state at the end of the file is used to generate
# the resulting output.

# End of file marker
